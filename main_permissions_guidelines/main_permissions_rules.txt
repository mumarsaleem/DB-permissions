keeping things in order - we have decided to keep the main guidelines in this directory.

Here are some guidelines 
1. to keep permissions intact 
2. and roles / groups properly tied with permissions guidelines 
3. and most important, use the groups and roles instead of stand-alone users.
4. and since we are just testing, keep the schema level guidelines in separate files.
